00:02.900 --> 00:04.600
That was kind of fast, right?

00:05.200 --> 00:06.620
Well, that's how we like to.

00:06.660 --> 00:10.320
Bro, we have bought one of Europe's leading tech companies,

00:10.840 --> 00:12.580
with almost 100 million customers.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
And over 2,000 employees,

00:15.060 --> 00:18.300
our company at this scale moves at this speed.

00:18.840 --> 00:19.840
Here are some examples.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.500
It took us five years to reach 10 million customers.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.240
Now we're adding 10 million every two months.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.580
Instead of reducing head count,

00:28.580 --> 00:32.580
we added another 500 employees and launched.

00:33.460 --> 00:37.580
Scooters and who delivery in 74 cities in 12 months.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.520
But that wasn't enough.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.600
So we launched car sharing with folks drive.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.380
And that took us four months.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.400
Months and groceries delivery followed just one month later.

00:49.060 --> 00:51.980
That's two new business lines in five months.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.540
How did we do it?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.540
Well, we don't spend time on bureaucracy.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.660
Instead, we move across into more teams.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.920
Teams, everybody acts like an owner.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.300
So a 13 owners launched both markets in one month.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.240
So when others are doing this.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.540
We're doing this.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.780
As the company grows, so did we.

01:16.060 --> 01:17.980
I started as a customer support specialist.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.420
And now I'm originally lead.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.440
And I started as a recruiter.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.420
And now I'm a global recruiter for manager.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.220
And I've been here for four and a half years.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.440
Which is a bullet average.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.240
That's one and a half years more than the industry average.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.940
And I drew and bold when it was just a small story on startup.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.220
And now it's the world's fastest growing money to platform.
