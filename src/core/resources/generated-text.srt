1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,600
That was kind of fast, right?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,620
Well, that's how we like to.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,320
Bro, we have bought one of Europe's leading tech companies,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,580
with almost 100 million customers.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And over 2,000 employees,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,300
our company at this scale moves at this speed.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
Here are some examples.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,500
It took us five years to reach 10 million customers.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,240
Now we're adding 10 million every two months.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,580
Instead of reducing head count,

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,580
we added another 500 employees and launched.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,580
Scooters and who delivery in 74 cities in 12 months.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
But that wasn't enough.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,600
So we launched car sharing with folks drive.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,380
And that took us four months.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,400
Months and groceries delivery followed just one month later.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,980
That's two new business lines in five months.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,540
How did we do it?

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,540
Well, we don't spend time on bureaucracy.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,660
Instead, we move across into more teams.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Teams, everybody acts like an owner.

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,300
So a 13 owners launched both markets in one month.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,240
So when others are doing this.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,540
We're doing this.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,780
As the company grows, so did we.

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,980
I started as a customer support specialist.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,420
And now I'm originally lead.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,440
And I started as a recruiter.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,420
And now I'm a global recruiter for manager.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,220
And I've been here for four and a half years.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,440
Which is a bullet average.

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,240
That's one and a half years more than the industry average.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,940
And I drew and bold when it was just a small story on startup.

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,220
And now it's the world's fastest growing money to platform.
