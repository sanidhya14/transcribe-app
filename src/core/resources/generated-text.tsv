33460	37580	Scooters and who delivery in 74 cities in 12 months.
38520	39520	But that wasn't enough.
39800	42600	So we launched car sharing with folks drive.
43000	44380	And that took us four months.
45200	48400	Months and groceries delivery followed just one month later.

64780	67240	So when others are doing this.
67880	69540	We're doing this.
73960	75780	As the company grows, so did we.
76060	77980	I started as a customer support specialist.
79400	81420	And now I'm originally lead.
82120	83440	And I started as a recruiter.
83820	86420	And now I'm a global recruiter for manager.
86700	88220	And I've been here for four and a half years.
88560	89440	Which is a bullet average.
90220	92240	That's one and a half years more than the industry average.
93160	95940	And I drew and bold when it was just a small story on startup.
96360	98220	And now it's the world's fastest growing money to platform.
